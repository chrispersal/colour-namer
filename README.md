_"Gone are the days where we had to grind up rare minerals to dye our garments. We live in an age of bountiful colour, where near every colour the human eye can percieve can be approximated by a display, and the gamut of usable colours will only widen with advancements of technology."_

Sadly, I've checked, and I'm not the first person to come up with the PANTONE/PANTSTONE joke, there's a RedBubble store with fake colour swatches such as "Furry Cheese" and "Bedsit Wall".
